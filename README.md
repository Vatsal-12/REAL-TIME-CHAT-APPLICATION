This is a real-time, browser-based chat application built using **React.js** on the frontend and **WebSocket technology** on the backend via **Node.js**. It allows multiple users to communicate instantly across browser tabs or devices by maintaining a persistent WebSocket connection. This is a minimal yet powerful foundation for understanding how real-time messaging systems work, and can be extended to support more advanced features like user authentication, chat rooms, message persistence, and file sharing.

## Description

In today’s fast-paced digital world, real-time communication is a core feature of many modern applications — from messaging apps to collaborative tools and online support systems. This project demonstrates how to build a real-time chat system using WebSockets, which offer full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which follow a request-response model, WebSockets allow the server to "push" messages to clients instantly, enabling real-time interactivity.

This application uses **React.js** to render a dynamic UI that responds to user input and live data. The **Node.js** server handles WebSocket connections using the `ws` library — a lightweight and performant choice. The client maintains a connection to the server and updates the UI whenever a message is received. You can open the application in two tabs or browsers to simulate multiple users chatting in real time.

Although simple in its current form, this application establishes a strong base for adding:
- **User profiles or nicknames**
- **Message timestamps**
- **Multiple chat rooms or private messaging**
- **Persistent storage using a database like MongoDB or Firebase**
- **File sharing or emojis**
